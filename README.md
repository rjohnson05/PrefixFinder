# Prefix Finder Program

This program allows a user to query the county name and license plate prefix for a Montana city.

If the user provides a city name found within the database (.txt file), the option is given to display the county name, license plate prefix, or both. However, if the city is not found within the database, the
user is asked to provide the county that the city is located in. The city is then added to the database with the provided county before giving the user to display the license plate prefix if desired. The user may
repeat as many queries as they desire before quitting the program.
